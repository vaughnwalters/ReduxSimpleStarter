redux is a predictable state container for javascript containers
- a colelction of all the data that describes the app
  this includes not only the hard data, but also includes, for example a curretly selsected piece of data
  - react contains the views

all of the data is inside a single object, called the state.  there is a distinction between component level state, and application level state... which is redux

redux contains the state of the application, that tells the components what they should render
